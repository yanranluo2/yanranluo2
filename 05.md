The platform offers capabilities for creating and managing knowledge bases from various data sources. These knowledge bases serve as the foundation for AI applications, providing the context necessary for generating accurate and relevant responses.

### **Ready-to-Use Templates**

Stack AI provides a library of pre-built templates based on real-world use cases. According to their website, these allow users to "achieve immediate results and customize to your needs" [Source: Stack AI website] [Build AI Agents with the Enterprise AI Platform | Stack AI](https://www.stack-ai.com/). During my project, I found these templates valuable for quickly establishing a functional foundation.

### **Deployment Options**

The platform supports multiple deployment methods, including API endpoints and customizable user interfaces. This flexibility allows AI workflows to be integrated into existing systems or deployed as standalone applications.

## **Hands-On Experience: Building a Workflow with Stack AI**

For my evaluation of Stack AI, I chose to build a job recommender system as a demonstration project. This system would serve as an AI Career Assistant focused on helping job seekers find relevant AI positions in the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) industry.

The system's core functionality would include analyzing uploaded resumes to identify key skills and qualifications, matching candidate profiles with current job listings from seek.au, providing personalized job recommendations with explanations of fit, and offering advice for improving applications and addressing skill gaps.

This use case was selected because it incorporates several key AI capabilities: document analysis, pattern matching, recommendation generation, and natural language explanation - making it an ideal test case for evaluating Stack AI's functionality.

## **Implementation Approach**

Building this system with Stack AI involved a straightforward workflow leveraging the platform's visual interface:

### **Knowledge Base Creation**

The first step was establishing a knowledge base of job listings using Stack AI's Website node. This involved setting up connections to retrieve job data from seek.au, organizing the information into a structured format for efficient querying, and creating a workflow for maintaining up-to-date job information.

### **AI Model Integration**

The core intelligence of the system relied on Stack AI's LLM integration. I implemented a workflow to analyze resume documents using Claude or GPT models and created system prompts to extract relevant skills and experience information. This was followed by developing matching logic to compare resume content against job requirements and setting up a recommendation system to rank and explain potential matches.

### **User Interface**

For the user experience, I configured a simple upload mechanism for resumes and designed a clear presentation format for job recommendations. The interface included explanations of why each position was recommended along with suggestions for improving job applications to better match requirements.

The entire implementation was completed using Stack AI's visual workflow builder without requiring custom code, demonstrating the platform's accessibility for non-technical users. While simple, this prototype effectively demonstrated how Stack AI can be used to create functional AI applications that solve real business problems.

## **User Experience with Stack AI**

Now I'll focus on the critical aspects of my hands-on experience using Stack AI to build the job recommender system. This section will provide practical insights into what it's actually like to use the platform.

### **Intuitive Interface**

Stack AI's user interface proved to be one of its strongest features, particularly for someone approaching the platform without extensive technical expertise. The visual workflow builder presents a clean, logical layout that makes the process of constructing AI workflows remarkably straightforward.

In my experience, the platform excels at abstracting away complexity without sacrificing functionality. Unlike more technical alternatives like n8n, Stack AI follows familiar SaaS design patterns that business professionals will recognize immediately. The node categories are logically organized, with descriptive labels that clearly communicate their purpose without requiring technical knowledge.

The hover tooltips and contextual help provided timely guidance exactly when needed, reducing the learning curve significantly. This thoughtful design enabled me to focus on building the job recommender logic rather than struggling with the interface itself.

### **Templates and Quick Start**

One of the most valuable aspects of Stack AI was its library of pre-built templates. These templates are inspired by real use cases and allow users to achieve immediate results and customize to their needs [Build AI Agents with the Enterprise AI Platform | Stack AI](https://www.stack-ai.com/).

While there wasn't a specific job recommender template available, I was able to adapt the knowledge base assistant template as a starting point. This approach saved considerable time compared to building from scratch and provided insight into best practices for structuring AI workflows.

### **Limitations of the Free Plan**

While Stack AI offers an impressive set of features, I encountered several significant limitations with the free plan that impacted my project's development. The most immediate constraint was the allowance of only 500 runs per month and a maximum of 2 projects, which I found depleted quickly during development and testing.

Feature restrictions were equally limiting, particularly the inability to incorporate custom Python code, which significantly constrained the sophistication of the matching algorithms I could implement.

Data integration presented another hurdle, with limited options for connecting to custom data sources and APIs, complicating the creation of a comprehensive database.

Perhaps most importantly, as the project progressed, it became increasingly clear that scaling to a production-ready system would require upgrading to a paid tier to access essential features like improved performance, increased reliability, and technical support. These limitations position Stack AI's free tier as suitable for proof-of-concept work and learning the platform, but inadequate for extensive development or production use.

### **Potential Enhancements with Pro Plan**

The free plan allowed me to create a basic prototype, but a production-ready system would benefit significantly from features available in Stack AI's paid tiers.

Python scripting stands out as perhaps the most valuable premium feature, enabling more sophisticated processing of resumes and job listings. With custom code, I could implement advanced matching algorithms that go beyond simple keyword matching to understand semantic relationships between different but related skills.

The Pro plan would also unlock expanded data integration capabilities, allowing direct connections to multiple job boards and existing resume repositories for more comprehensive coverage. This would provide a broader view of available positions and enable comparative analysis against industry standards.

The user experience could be significantly enhanced through custom UI development, creating a branded interface with interactive features like skill comparison charts and application tracking. For deployment at scale, the Pro plan offers essential operational features including increased run limits to handle peak usage, enhanced security for sensitive resume information, and compliance tools to ensure adherence to employment regulations.

Advanced analytics would transform the system from a simple matching tool into a strategic resource by tracking usage patterns, monitoring application success rates, and aggregating data on common skill deficiencies to identify training opportunities.

These enhancements highlight Stack AI's tiered approach to feature access -- while the free plan demonstrates basic capabilities, unlocking the platform's full potential for sophisticated applications requires investment in premium features.
