Stack AI provides access to a variety of large language models from different providers. According to their comparison with Microsoft Copilot Studio, "Stack AI integrates with all the leading LLMs on the market, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and many others" [Microsoft Copilot Studio vs. Stack AI: A Comprehensive Comparison | Stack AI · The Platform for Enterprise AI](https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/microsoft-copilot-studio-versus-stack-ai). This flexibility allows users to select the optimal model for specific use cases.

### **Knowledge Base Creation Tools**

The platform offers capabilities for creating and managing knowledge bases from various data sources. These knowledge bases serve as the foundation for AI applications, providing the context necessary for generating accurate and relevant responses.

### **Ready-to-Use Templates**

Stack AI provides a library of pre-built templates based on real-world use cases, which allow users to achieve immediate results and customize to their needs. During my project, I found these templates valuable for quickly establishing a functional foundation.

### **Deployment Options**

The platform supports multiple deployment methods, including API endpoints and customizable user interfaces. This flexibility allows AI workflows to be integrated into existing systems or deployed as standalone applications.

## **Hands-On Experience: Building a Workflow with Stack AI**

For my evaluation of Stack AI, I chose to build a job recommender system as a demonstration project. This system would serve as an AI Career Assistant focused on helping job seekers find relevant AI positions in the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) industry.

The system's core functionality would include analyzing uploaded resumes to identify key skills and qualifications, matching candidate profiles with current job listings from seek.au, providing personalized job recommendations with explanations of fit, and offering advice for improving applications and addressing skill gaps.

This use case was selected because it incorporates several key AI capabilities: document analysis, pattern matching, recommendation generation, and natural language explanation - making it an ideal test case for evaluating Stack AI's functionality.

## **Implementation Approach**

Building this system with Stack AI involved a straightforward workflow leveraging the platform's visual interface:

### **Knowledge Base Creation**

The first step was establishing a knowledge base of job listings using Stack AI's Website node. This involved setting up connections to retrieve job data from seek.au, organizing the information into a structured format for efficient querying, and creating a workflow for maintaining up-to-date job information.

### **AI Model Integration**

The core intelligence of the system relied on Stack AI's LLM integration. I implemented a workflow to analyze resume documents using Claude or GPT models and created system prompts to extract relevant skills and experience information. This was followed by developing matching logic to compare resume content against job requirements and setting up a recommendation system to rank and explain potential matches.

### **User Interface**

For the user experience, I configured a simple upload mechanism for resumes and designed a clear presentation format for job recommendations. The interface included explanations of why each position was recommended along with suggestions for improving job applications to better match requirements.

The entire implementation was completed using Stack AI's visual workflow builder without requiring custom code, demonstrating the platform's accessibility for non-technical users. While simple, this prototype effectively demonstrated how Stack AI can be used to create functional AI applications that solve real business problems.

## **User Experience with Stack AI**

Now I'll focus on the critical aspects of my hands-on experience using Stack AI to build the job recommender system. This section will provide practical insights into what it's actually like to use the platform.

### **Intuitive Interface**

Stack AI's user interface proved to be one of its strongest features, particularly for someone approaching the platform without extensive technical expertise. The visual workflow builder presents a clean, logical layout that makes the process of constructing AI workflows remarkably straightforward.

In my experience, the platform excels at abstracting away complexity without sacrificing functionality. Unlike more technical alternatives like n8n, Stack AI follows familiar SaaS design patterns that business professionals will recognize immediately. The node categories are logically organized, with descriptive labels that clearly communicate their purpose without requiring technical knowledge.

The hover tooltips and contextual help provided timely guidance exactly when needed, reducing the learning curve significantly. This thoughtful design enabled me to focus on building the job recommender logic rather than struggling with the interface itself.

### **Templates and Quick Start**

While there wasn't a specific job recommender template available, I was able to adapt the knowledge base assistant template as a starting point. This approach saved considerable time compared to building from scratch and provided insight into best practices for structuring AI workflows.

### **Limitations of the Free Plan**

While Stack AI offers an impressive set of features, I encountered several significant limitations with the free plan that impacted my project's development. The most immediate constraint was the allowance of only 100 runs per month and a maximum of 1 project, which I found depleted quickly during development and testing.

Feature restrictions were equally limiting, particularly the inability to incorporate custom Python code, which significantly constrained the sophistication of the matching algorithms I could implement.

Data integration presented another hurdle, with limited options for connecting to custom data sources and APIs, complicating the creation of a comprehensive database.

Perhaps most importantly, as the project progressed, it became increasingly clear that scaling to a production-ready system would require upgrading to a paid tier to access essential features like improved performance, increased reliability, and technical support. These limitations position Stack AI's free tier as suitable for proof-of-concept work and learning the platform, but inadequate for extensive development or production use.

### **Potential Enhancements with Pro Plan**

The free plan allowed me to create a basic prototype, but a production-ready system would benefit significantly from features available in Stack AI's paid tiers.
